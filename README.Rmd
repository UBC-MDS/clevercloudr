# clevercloudr

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of clevercloudr is to to serve as the one-step solution to create meaningful and visually appealing word clouds. To create meaningful word clouds, data scientists typically takes multiple steps to clean the data, such as removing stopwords, removing punctuation and digits, making the letters lower cases, conducting lemmatization and stemming. This package will help data scientists clean the data easily following the common practices and also allow to create more visually appealing word clouds in relevant shapes.

## **Functions**

There are 4 functions in this package:

-   `CleverClean` A preprocessor to convert all the letters to lower case and remove punctuations.

-   `CleverLemStem` A preprocessor to conduct lemmatization and stemming on the text.

-   `CleverStopwords` A comprehensive list of English stopwords that allow adding more customized words.

-   `CleverWordCloud` As function to generate a visually appealing word cloud with customized shape and stopwords.

## **Fitting into the R ecosystem**

Packages that have similar functions:

-   [wordcloud](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/wordcloud/versions/2.6/topics/wordcloud): a word count generator that emphasis more frequently used words from an array of strings and represents them in the form of an image.

What we do different:

-   Our aim is to improve on the pre-processing of strings before creating a wordcloud in order to make it more user specific and efficient.

-   Word cloud only eliminates limited amount of stopwords, but with our package we are giving users the opportunity to add more stopwords that cater to their analysis.

-   We are focused on removing as many redundant and duplicate words by setting strings to lower case, removing punctuation, lemmatizing and stemming the text.

## Installation

You can install the development version of clevercloudr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UBC-MDS/clevercloudr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(clevercloudr)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
